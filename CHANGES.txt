    Added type detection by filename. Added examples and man page and did some
    internal cleanups.

aafigure 0.2    2009-06-12
    Separated into standalone project. Previously it was found in the docutils
    sandbox. The Docutils plugin for the aafigure directive is separated and
    aafigure is now a standalone package and command line tool. The plugin is
    still available as separate package that uses aafigure as dependency.

    Added Debian control files to build a package.
